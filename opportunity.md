# The Opportunity

### Context and Geological Location

The mining project is located in the municipality of Bagadó, Chocó, a region known for its geological wealth and mining potential. The deposit lies within the Farallones Batholith, a geological formation that contains significant concentrations of primary gold. This project aims to develop a world-class mining operation under the highest international standards of responsible exploration and exploitation.

### Legal Framework and Ancestral Rights

The project area is within an indigenous reserve, activating the legal framework of Ancestral Rights protected by the Colombian Constitution and international treaties such as ILO Convention 169. This framework guarantees the autonomy of indigenous communities over their territories, including the management of projects that affect their lands.

In this context, the indigenous communities have decided to participate as partners in the project. This not only ensures compliance with their rights but also guarantees that the project’s development respects their traditions and aspirations. This associative model is innovative and sustainable, promoting the economic development of the communities while respecting their values and culture.

Ancestral rights in Colombia are deeply tied to the recognition and protection of the rights of Indigenous peoples, Afro-descendant communities, and Raizal communities. This legal framework is grounded in the 1991 Political Constitution, which establishes a multicultural and multi-ethnic model aimed at protecting the customs, territories, and ways of life of these communities. The key legal context is as follows:

**1. Constitutional Basis:**

- **Article 7:** Recognizes and protects the ethnic and cultural diversity of the Colombian nation.
- **Article 63:** Declares communal territories of Indigenous and Afro-descendant communities as inalienable, imprescriptible, and non-seizable.
- **Articles 286 and 287:** Establish the autonomy of territorial entities, including Indigenous reserves, which have their own normative systems.
- **Article 330:** Recognizes the right of Indigenous peoples to exercise authority within their territories and manage their natural resources in coordination with the National Government.

**2. Specific Legislation:**

- **Law 21 of 1991:** Ratifies the International Labour Organization (ILO) Convention 169 on Indigenous and Tribal Peoples, which establishes fundamental rights such as prior consultation and respect for culture and traditions.
- **Law 70 of 1993:** Grants territorial rights to Afro-descendant communities and regulates the use of natural resources in their collective territories.
- **Decree 1953 of 2014:** Creates a special regime for the exercise of Indigenous self-government, enabling their authorities to carry out administrative and judicial functions.

### Security and Collaboration with the Organization

The project also has the active support of the Organization, a local actor present in the region. While its involvement might be seen as a potential risk, its support ensures the project’s feasibility by providing stability in the area. The Organization has demonstrated its commitment by joining as a partner in the project, fostering collaboration that minimizes risks and ensures safe operational conditions.

### Subsoil Ownership and Legal Permits

In Colombia, mineral resources in the subsoil are owned by the State. To operate legally, a mining title and an environmental license are required. This joint project, supported by indigenous communities and the Organization, aims to complete all geological, environmental, and social studies to the highest international standards. This will allow the submission of a robust application to the State for obtaining the necessary permits.
